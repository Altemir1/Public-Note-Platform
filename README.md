# Public Note Platform â€“ Cloud Computing Project 2025 Summer

## Overview
This is a distributed web application for managing public notes, developed as part of a cloud computing course project. The backend is built with Java Spring Boot, Redis is used as a cache/database, and HAProxy acts as a load balancer. The system is containerized with Docker, orchestrated via Docker Compose for local testing and Kubernetes (Minikube) for deployment. All services run on custom-built images based on the OpenSUSE Leap Linux distribution.


## Technologies Used
- Java 17, Spring Boot
- Redis (custom-configured)
- HAProxy (HTTP load balancing)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes with Minikube
- OpenSUSE Leap (base image)
- Maven

## Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Java 17 & Maven
- Minikube
- Git


## Running Locally with Docker Compose
```sh
cd ../../
docker-compose up --build
```

### Access Points
- HAProxy load balancer: [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)
- HAProxy dashboard: http://localhost:8404 . To access it you need to use these credentials:
Username: admin, Passowrd: admin.

## Architecture
- **app1** and **app2**: Two Spring Boot containers behind HAProxy
- **redis**: Single Redis instance, used by both apps
- **haproxy**: Balances HTTP traffic across both app instances

## Deploying with Kubernetes (Minikube)
1. Start Minikube and Ingress
```sh
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress
```
2. Build Images Inside minikube
```sh
eval $(minikube docker-env)

docker build -t cloud_computing_project_2025_summer-app -f docker/app/Dockerfile .

docker build -t redis-image ./docker/redis
```

3. Deploy Everything
```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s.yaml
```

4. Update /etc/hosts
```sh
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
Add: 127.0.0.1 publicnotes.test

5. Run the Tunnel (On separate terminal)
```sh
sudo minikube tunnel
```

6. Access the App
https://publicnotes.test


## Notes
- All containers are built using OpenSUSE Leap base images.
- app1 and app2 are identical deployments for horizontal scaling.
- Redis is isolated on the backend network (or within Kubernetes cluster).
- HAProxy listens on port 80 and optionally 8404 for stats (if configured).
- Kubernetes uses `imagePullPolicy: Never` to run local images loaded into Minikube.

## Summary
| Component   | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| app1, app2  | Java Spring Boot note app replicas          |
| redis       | Redis with custom config & persistent volume|
| haproxy     | Load balances requests to app1 and app2     |
| Minikube    | Local Kubernetes cluster for deployment     |
